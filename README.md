Introduction
------------
Implementation of the experiments as submitted to the Information Sciences Journal.

The main scripts used to run the experiments to estimate the MI and detect leakage are cluster_script.py and cluster_script_ild.py. We used a Postgres database to configure all the jobs. The job configurations for running different mutual information estimation techniques on synthetic datasets, used by `cluster_script.py`, are uploaded as:

1. `database\mutual_information.avail_jobs.csv`
2. `database\mutual_information.running_jobs.csv`
3. `database\automl.avail_jobs.csv`
4. `database\automl.running_jobs.csv`

For running the experiments to detect information leakage on real datasets generated using OpenSSL TLS server, used by `cluster_script_ild.py`, the configurations are uploaded as:

1. `database\leakage_detection_padding.avail_jobs.csv`
2. `database\leakage_detection_padding.running_jobs.csv`

These files contain all the necessary configurations to execute the respective tasks within your experiments. Ensure to update and review these files as needed for your simulations.

The package autoqild can be installed using the instructions below:
